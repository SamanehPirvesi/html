<div style="width:50% ;background-color:blue; float:left ;"> The border style, combined with border width and border color, can also be specified with the border shorthand property.

With one value, the border-style property can be used to specify a uniform style border around a box. With two, three, or four values, sides can be specified independently.

<hr style="clear:both;">
<div style=" border-radius:10px;width:300px;height:300px;border-style:dotted;border-color:blue; border-width:10px;">Note that when using the collapsing border model (border-collapsed tables),
 a none value may not always appear to work, due to another element having a non-none value. This is because multiple elements can share the same edge in border-collapsed tables. For example,
  a table, tbody, tr, and td could all share the same edge and have different border settings.

To completely turn the border off, either make all elements that share that edge none, or use hidden on any of the elements that share that edge.</div>
<div style=" border-top-left-radius:20px;border-bottom-right-radius:20px;width:300px;height:300px;border-color:red;border-style:solid; border-width:10px;">Same as none, but in the collapsing border model (border-collapsed tables),
also inhibits any other border. In other words, when multiple edges come together with different border settings (for example, a table and a td, each with their own border settings),
 if any one of those is hidden, it will prevent any border at that edge.
 This is different to none, 
in that all elements meeting that edge must have none before the border is omitted.</div>
<div style="width:50%;height:50px;background-color:yellow;overflow:auto; outline-color:orange;outline-width:10px;outline-style:double;border:10px solid red;">solid: A solid, continuous line.
none (default): No line is drawn.
hidden: A line is drawn, but not visible. this can be handy for adding a little extra width to an element without displaying a border.
dashed: A line that consists of dashes.
dotted: A line that consists of dots.
double: Two lines are drawn around the element.
groove: Adds a bevel based on the color value in a way that makes the element appear pressed into the document.
ridge: Similar to groove, but reverses the color values in a way that makes the element appear raised.
inset: Adds a split tone to the line that makes the element appear slightly depressed.</div>
